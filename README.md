# SpaceX Rocket Landing Classifier

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the success or failure of SpaceX rocket landings using machine learning classification techniques. The classification model is built using a series of steps, including data collection from SpaceX sites, data cleaning, data visualization, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gathered data from SpaceX sites to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Processed and cleaned the dataset to handle missing values and ensure data consistency.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Utilized Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing trends and patterns in the rocket landing data.

4. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Engineered relevant features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

5. **Model Building:**
   - Implemented a classification model using Scikit-learn, incorporating algorithms suitable for binary classification tasks.

6. **Evaluation:**
   - Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tools Used

- SQL for data manipulation and integration.
- Python for data analysis and machine learning.
- Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the classification model.
